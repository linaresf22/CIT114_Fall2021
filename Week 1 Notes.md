## Cloud Concept Overview

* Quote via TechRadar.com "Cloud compututing services also offer the advantage of being scalable, which means not only can you access additional resources exactly as you need them, but you are also charged only for the services you use so there's no need to buy in extra hardware for additional redundancy."

What is Information Tech (IT)?
* Computing Power (CPU, RAM)
* Storage (Files, Database)
* Networking (wire, wireless) Keeping things running
* Security and Identity Management 
* Management 1. Billing and cost management 2.Compliance and Governance
* Apps & Websites

Hardware and Software
* Software includes data, apps, code, configuration files that are stored digitally
* Hardware is all the physical aspect of an IT system: Computer, Monitors, Input and Output Devices, ETC.

Four Pillars of IT Framework:
* Infrastructure
* Development
* Security
* Data

Terminology to consider for Cloud Computing:
* CPU (Center Processing Unit): "The CPU is the primary component of a computer that processes instructions. It runs the operating system and applications, constantly receiving input from the user or active software programs. It processes the data and produces output, which may be stored by an application or displayed on a screen."
   * ARM Processor (in mobile phones): "The ARM(Advanced RISC Machines) processor is a 32-bit RISC processor, meaning it is built using the RISC (reduced instruction set computer) ISA (instruction set architecture)." PDA's (personal digital assistants): digital media and music layer, hand-hed gaming systems, calculators, tablets, and computer hard drives.
   * 32-bit and 64-bit Architecture Processors (in laptops, workstations (desktops), or servers): 
      * 32-bit: 4 GB of memory
      * 64-bit: theoretical maximum of 16.8 million TB (8 TB of addressable RAM) can come in dual-core, quad-core, six-core, and eight-core versions for home computing. Multiple cores allow for an increased number of calculations per second that can be performed, which can increase the processing power and help make a computer run faster.
       
* RAM (Random Access Memory): RAM is made up of small memory chips that form a memory module. These modules are installed in the RAM slots on the motherboard of your computer
* Storage:
   * Hard Disk Drive (HDD): A hard disk drive (sometimes abbreviated as hard drive, HD, or HDD) is a non-volatile memory hardware device that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer. A hard drive is a secondary storage device that consists of one or more platters to which data is written using a magnetic head, all inside of an air-sealed casing. Internal hard disks reside in a drive bay, connect to the motherboard, and are powered by a connection to the PSU (power supply unit).
   * Solid State Drive (SSD): Short for solid-state drive (or solid-state disk, although it doesn't use a disk mechanism), an SSD is a storage medium that uses non-volatile memory as a means of holding and accessing data. Unlike a hard drive, an SSD has no moving parts which gives it advantages such as faster access time, noiseless operation, higher reliability, and lower power consumption. 

* Case: The computer case encloses and holds most of the components of the system. It provides support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies, and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components.
* Cooling: 
   * Fan: a hardware device that keeps the overall computer or a computer device cool by circulating air to or from the computer or component
   * Heat Sink: a device that incorporates either a fan or some other means to keep a hot component, such as a processor, cooled down. There are two heat sink types: active and passive. The picture is an example of a passive heat sink.
      * Active heat sinks utilize the computer's power supply and may include a fan. Sometimes these types of heat sinks are referred to as an HSF, which is short for heat sink and fan.
      * Passive heat sinks are those that have no mechanical components. Consequently, they are 100% reliable. Passive heat sinks are made of an aluminum finned radiator that dissipates heat through convection. For passive heat sinks to work to their full capacity, there should be a steady airflow moving across the fins.
   * Liquid Cooling: used to reduce the temperature of its hardware, specifically the CPU and GPU. Liquid is more efficient than gas at conducting thermal energy
* Power Supply: The power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage direct current (DC) power for the internal components of the computer.
* Input / Output Devices: 
   * Input Devices: llow the user to enter data into a system, or control its operation. Most computers have a mouse and keyboard, but laptop systems typically use a touchpad instead of a mouse. Other input devices include webcams, microphones, joysticks, and image scanners.
   * Output Device: are designed around the senses of human beings which include vision, hearing, or touch. For example, monitors display images that can be seen or read, speakers produce audio that can be heard. Such devices also include printers, speakers, monitors or a Braille embosser.
