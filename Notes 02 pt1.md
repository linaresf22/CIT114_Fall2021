## Cloud Economics and Billings
_**Cloud Computing Service Models: SAAS, PAAS, & IAAS**_
1. **SAAS** : Software as a Service
   * Definition:  allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. (example: Google or Microsoft Office 365)
   * Provides a complete software solution that you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. 
   * Who uses it? **End Customers**
   * What does it do?
      * Hosted applications/apps
      * Developement tools, database management, business analytics
      * Operating systems
      * Servers and storage
      * Networking firewalls/security
      * Data center physical plant/building
   * What do you pay for?
      * such as customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and document management. You pay for the use of these apps by subscription or according to the level of use.
   * Advantages: 
      * Gain access to sophisticated applications.
      * Pay only for what you use.
      * Use free client softwar
      * Mobilize your workforce easily. 
      * Access app data from anywhere.
   * Disadvantages: 
      * Portability & Browser Issues
      * Internet performance may dictate overall performance
      * Compliance Restrictions
2.**PAAS**: Platform as a Service
   * Definition:a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. Example: force.com
   * Who uses it? **Developers**
   * What does it do?
      * Developement tools, database management, business analytics
      * Operating systems
      * Servers and storage
      * Networking firewalls/security
      * Data center physical plant/building
   * What do you pay for?
      * PaaS is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating.It allows you to avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing software licenses, the underlying application infrastructure and middleware or the development tools and other resources. 
   * Advantages:
      * Cut coding time
      * Add developement capabilities without adding staff
      * Develop for multiple platforms - including mobile - more easily.
      * Use sophisticated tools affordably.
      * Support geographically distributed development teams.
      * Efficiently manage the application lifecycle. 
      * Faster market for Developers
      * Easy Deployment of Web Applications
      * Private or Public Deployment is possible
   * Disadvantages:
      * Developers are limited to the providers' languages & tools
      * Migration Issues- Such as the risk of vendor lock-in
3. **IAAS**: Infrastruction as a Service
   * Definition:an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet. Quickly scale up and down with demand, and pay only for what you use. Examples: EC2, iCloud, google cloud, Azure Microsoft 
   * Who uses it? **SysAdmins**
   * What does it do?
      * Servers and storage
      * Networking firewalls/security
      * Data center physical plant/building
      * Test and development
      * Website Hosting
      * Storage, backup, and recovery
      * Web apps
      * High-performance computing
      * Big data analysis
   * What do you pay for?
      * The cloud computing service provider manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own softwareâ€”operating systems, middleware, and applications.
   * Advantages:
      * Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost.
      * Improves business continuity and disaster recovery.
      * Innovate rapidly.
      * Respond quicker to shifting business conditions.
      * Focus on your core business. 
      * Increase stability, reliability, and supportability.
      * Better security.
      * Gets new apps to users faster.
      * The Cloud provides the Infrastructure
      * Enhanced Scalability - Dynamic Workloads are supported
      * IaaS is Flexible
   * Disadvantages:
      * Security Issues
      * Network & Service Delays
