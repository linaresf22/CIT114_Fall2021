* Part Three: Knowledge Questions
   1. What are the advantages of cloud computing over on-premises?
      * You can go global in seconds
      * You pay-as-you-go.
      * You can avoid large purchases of storage you might not use.
      * Faster speed and agility. 
      * Avoid paying for physical storage devices. 
   2. Given setup instructions above, give examples of three different businesses that might begin with this setup.
      * EC2 allows you to create a website and track traffic. RDS allows you to create any kind of database and can store up to 30 free GB of data per month for free. Finally, VPC allows you to create a private cloud and give indivuals access to your projects as needed. 
   3. If we wanted to keep a close eye on how much the services were costing, which AWS service would we make use of?
      * There are multiple AWS services that help you track cost. I would prefere to set billing alerts to be constantly notified if my AWS accounts exceed my expected limit. 
   4. We need to choose a support plan for the system we set up. What are four different support plans offered by AWS?
      * AWS Budgets, it send emails and text messages to warn you about exceeding a limit alert on your account. 
      * Cloud Fianancial Management alls you to analyze the cost of AWS services to best fit your budget.
      * In the S3 Features, you can enable cost effeciency by setting a limit of how much you are willing to spend.
      * AWS Cost Management tracks all your AWS expenses and provides detailed charts of operation. 
   5. How many hours of service does the free-tier of EC2 provide during a billing cycle?
      * 720 hours per month
   6. What is the minimum size subnet you can have in an Amazon VPC?
       * The minimum size of a subnet is a /28 (or 14 IP addresses.
   7. What is the maximum size IP address range you can have in an Amazon VPC?
       *  The maximum VPC size of /16 (65,536 IPs)
   8. Which Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) feature would ensure our instances will not share a physical host with instances from any other AWS Customer?
       * Dedicated Instances
   9.  Let's say our storage requirement allows for a delayed retrieval of data (ie. medical records from ex-patients). Which S3 feature should we choose?
        * Encryption
        * Logging
        * Acess Control
   10. List and briefly describe the four basic database commands.
       * Select - extracts data
       * Delete - deletes data
       * Insert - inserts new data
       * Edit - edits the already existing data
